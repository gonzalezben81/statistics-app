# Statistics Application

This application is able to perform basic statistical analysis for an end user. Statistical calculations such as correlation, cross-tabulation, simple linear regression, multiple linear regression and visualization are able to be performed. The user simply needs to format their data into **.csv** or **.txt** file and then begin their analysis. 

**Note: The maximum upload size for a file is currently unknown.**


### File Upload

+ This tab allows a user to upload a .csv file or .txt file to the appliacation to perform basic statistical analysis.
